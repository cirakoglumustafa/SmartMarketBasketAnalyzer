This project has the ability to convert a CSV file to Excel format and optionally translate it to Turkish. Then, data is read from this Excel file and converted to a format similar to a shopping cart. Subsequently, frequent item sets are analyzed using the Apriori algorithm on this data, and relational connections are captured. For example, associative rules such as when a customer buys apples, there's an 85% chance they'll also buy bananas are identified.

Finally, these analysis results are saved to an Excel file. This allows users to easily track data analysis and enables the examination of results later.

The project can be used in areas such as the analysis of shopping data and understanding customer behavior. Based on these analysis results, businesses can determine marketing strategies and optimize product placements. Additionally, they can make more informed decisions to increase customer satisfaction and revenue.
